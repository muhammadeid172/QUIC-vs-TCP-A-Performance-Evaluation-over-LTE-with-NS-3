# QUIC vs TCP: A Performance Evaluation over LTE with NS-3
This repository is a part of a project in Computer Communication at The Technion Institute of Technology.

The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of QUIC and TCP over LTE network.

Within the project, we will restore the simulation scenarios described in this [article](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=113892), then compare and analyze QUIC and TCP performances considering 4 KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
1. Steady State Throughput
2. Flow Fairness
3. File Download Times
4. Effect of QUIC Streams on Throughput




The project is done by 3 members: Muhammad Eid, Abed Aeed and Waqqas Mardawy, and is supervised by Eran Tavor.
